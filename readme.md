# 📝 FastAPI Todo List Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end Todo List REST API** developed using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**.  
The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on todo items.

The API was tested using **Postman** and successfully deployed on the **Render cloud platform**.  
Both **localhost** and **live server** environments were tested to understand real-world backend development and deployment workflows.
